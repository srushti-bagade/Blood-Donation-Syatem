# 🩸 Blood Donation Management System
The "Blood Donation System" is a web-based DBMS mini-project developed to streamline the process of blood donation and request management. This project is designed to maintain accurate records of blood donors, recipients, donations, and blood requests, thereby enhancing transparency and efficiency. The system uses MySQL as the backend database, and PHP for backend scripting, along with HTML/CSS for the frontend. The project includes five main modules: Donors, Donations, Recipients, Requests, and Admins. The system enables administrators to manage donor and recipient records, monitor donations and requests, and ensure data integrity through relational database constraints. It ultimately aims to provide a centralized, secure, and user-friendly platform to bridge the gap between donors and recipients.
